<h1>Privacy Policy for Hint – Quick Notes. No Pen.</h1>

<p>
Hint – Quick Notes. No Pen. does <strong>not collect, store, or share any personal user data</strong>.
</p>

<p>
This extension only accesses the text that the user explicitly selects on a webpage when they choose the 
<strong>“Add to Notes”</strong> option from the context menu.
</p>

<p>
The selected text, notes, and collections are saved <strong>locally inside the user’s browser</strong> using Chrome storage and are 
<strong>never transmitted to any server</strong>.
</p>

<h2>What we do NOT do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do not track browsing history</li>
  <li>We do not monitor user activity</li>
  <li>We do not collect personal information</li>
  <li>We do not share any data with third parties</li>
</ul>

<p>
All notes, collections, and saved content remain stored only on the user’s device.
</p>

<h2>Permissions Explanation</h2>

<h3>activeTab</h3>
<p>
The <strong>activeTab</strong> permission is used only when the user explicitly selects text on a webpage and chooses 
<strong>“Add to Notes”</strong> from the context menu. This temporary access allows the extension to read the selected text 
from the current tab and save it into the user’s notes. The extension does not access any webpage data unless 
the user performs this action.
</p>

<h3>scripting</h3>
<p>
The <strong>scripting</strong> permission is used to run a small script on the active webpage to capture the text that 
the user has selected. This script runs only after the user clicks <strong>“Add to Notes”</strong> from the context menu 
and is required to retrieve the selected content from the page.
</p>

<h3>sidePanel</h3>
<p>
The <strong>sidePanel</strong> permission is used to open the notes editor inside Chrome’s side panel when the user 
selects text from a webpage. In the side panel, users can preview and edit the selected text before saving it, 
add it to an existing note, or create a new note and collection. The side panel also displays the list of 
previously created notes and collections and provides a button to navigate to the main dashboard. 
From the editor, users can manage their notes by editing, organizing, deleting, and downloading them as 
<strong>PDF, Word, or text files</strong>.
</p>

<h3>storage</h3>
<p>
The <strong>storage</strong> permission is used to save notes, collections, and user content locally within the browser.
</p>

<h2>User Control</h2>
<p>
Users have full control over their data. They can edit, delete, organize, and download their notes at any time 
as PDF, Word, or text files.
